# Clustering-process

This repository contains the by KTH developed QGIS plugin used in order to generate population clusters.   

### Content

This repository contains instruction on how to install and use the clustering plugin developed by KTH as well as three different plugins used for different types of data and versions of QGIS.


### How-to-use Instructions 

#### Available versions of the plugin
As of July 2019 there are three different plugins avialble:

  1. One using the population data obtained from the Global Human Settlement Layer (available here: https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/). Note that this version of the plugin is only avialble for QGIS version 3.2
  2. One plugin developed for QGIS version 3.2 using the population data obtained from the High Resolution Settlement Layer (available here: https://data.humdata.org/organization/facebook?sort=metadata_modifieddesc&page=1&q=&ext_page_size=25#dataset-filter-start)
  3. One plugin developed for QGIS version 3.4 (the latest stable version) using the population data obtained from the High Resolution Settlement Layer.

**Note:** The KTH team has found that the High Resolution Settlement Layer (HRSL) is more detailed and elaborate than the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL). The HRSL is not avialble on a global scale. The users are recommended to first check the availability of HRSL for their area of interest and then move to GHSL if HRSL is not available.
